Year of Code 2011
New code, every week. For a year.

These are the terms:
- Minimum of once per week I will check in something to Github.
- The complexity of my check-in will be highly variable but it must be a complete entity (I.e. At least functional in some regards, not necessarily tested in to oblivion).
- “Complete entity” is defined as either a new script/program or a new feature to something existing (technically I could contribute to an existing OSS project)
