This week the program is a Nagios check command for monitoring Solar Weather.

You're probably asking why anyone would want to monitor solar weather with Nagios!?
My motivation is because it's because it's ridiculous. Too often in the world of testing, I hear about testers too worried about testing far-flung testing scenarios han doing intelligent core functional testing. 
When I say far-flung scenarios, I mean really ridiculous situations. Stuff like: "we should corrupt the database and see if the product works still!" or "we should test if having a sound card in the server causes log files to not be written to disk" (I've made these up to protect the guilty, but this is illustrative)
As a commentary on this testing methodology, I write this Nagios check command so someone can use it to be alerted in the event of Solar Weather events that _may_ be affecting the software product under test. Because if you aren't testing for it, then clearly you should be worried about how Solar X-Rays may be affecting your product's ability to read from a corrupted database or write to a log file.
